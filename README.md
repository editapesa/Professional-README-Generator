# Professional README Generator

## Description
A high quality README file is important to have when creating projects as a developer. It is the first thing someone sees when viewing a repository, and contains important information about the project. In this assignment, a README file will be created by using a command-line application.

## Installation
In the code editor, select the folder in use and open the Integrated Terminal (or GitBash). From there `npm init` will be run followed by `npm i` to install a `package.json` with the required dependencies. The application can then be started by entering the command `node index.js`.

## Usage
Please see how the application works by viewing the following video.
